Advanced Physical Design project - A complete P&R flow was carried out on Picorv32 SoC using OpenLane SkyWater-130nm Pdk on riscV, as part of the course "Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130" conducted by VLSI System Design Corporation. PicoRV32 is a CPU core that implements the RISC-V RV32IMC Instruction Set which is used as an example in this course.

Introduction to OpenLane
OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII. You can check out the documentation, including in-depth guides and reference manuals at ReadTheDocs.

OpenLane Design Stages
OpenLane flow consists of several stages. By default all flow steps are run in sequence. Each stage may consist of multiple sub-stages. OpenLane can also be run interactively as shown here.

Synthesis
yosys/abc - Perform RTL synthesis and technology mapping.
OpenSTA - Performs static timing analysis on the resulting netlist to generate timing reports
Floorplaning
init_fp - Defines the core area for the macro as well as the rows (used for placement) and the tracks (used for routing)
ioplacer - Places the macro input and output ports
pdngen - Generates the power distribution network
tapcell - Inserts welltap and decap cells in the floorplan
Placement
RePLace - Performs global placement
Resizer - Performs optional optimizations on the design
OpenDP - Performs detailed placement to legalize the globally placed components
CTS
TritonCTS - Synthesizes the clock distribution network (the clock tree)
Routing
FastRoute - Performs global routing to generate a guide file for the detailed route
TritonRoute - Performs detailed routing
OpenRCX - Performs SPEF extraction
Tapeout
Magic - Streams out the final GDSII layout file from the routed def
KLayout - Streams out the final GDSII layout file from the routed def as a back-up
Signoff
Magic - Performs DRC Checks & Antenna Checks
KLayout - Performs DRC Checks
Netgen - Performs LVS Checks
CVC - Performs Circuit Validity Checks
Invoking OpenLANE and Design Preparation
Invoking_Openlane

Preparation step basically sets up the directory structure, merges the technology LEF (.tlef) and cell LEF(.lef) into one. Tech LEF contains the layer informations and cell LEF contains the cell informations. All the designs are placed under the designs directory for openLANE flow. Directory structure of picrorv32a before and after executing prep command. src: contains verilog files and constraints file config.tcl: contains the configurations used by openLANE

There are three configuration files:

Each phase used in the process flow has a configuration tcl file under openlane_working_dir/openlane/configuration/<phase_name>.tcl
Each design will have its own config.tcl file
Each design will have its own pdk specific tcl file, sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl which has the highest precedence.
Synthesis
To synthesize the design

% run_synthesis
Running Synthesis RunningSynthesis
-Calculating Flip Flop ratio No_of_flip-flops

dfxtp_2 = 1613, Number of cells = 14876, Flop ratio = 1613/14876 = 0.1084 = 10.84%

Synthesis logs and report will be captured under runs directory. All the configuration parameters related to synthesis phase are available in synthesis.tcl

Floorplaning
Floorplanning phase deals with setting die area, core area, core utilization factor, aspect ratio, placing of macros, decoupling capacitors, power distribution networks and placement of IO pins.

To run floorplanning phase

% run_floorplan

Floor planning phase generate DEF file which contains core area and placement details of standard cells.

To see Floorplan in Magic
DEF file generated by floorplan phase can be utilized by magic tool to get the floorplan view which requires 3 configuration files: * Magic technology file (sky130A.tech) * DEF file from floorplan phase * Merged LEF file from preparation phase Screenshot from 2023-08-13 02-31-32

Placement
Placement determine the locations of standard cells or logic elements within each block.Some circuit elements may have fixed locations while others are movable.

Global placement: Global placement assigns general locations to movable objects. Some overlaps are allowed between placed objects.

Detailed placement: Detailed placement refines object locations to legal cell sites and enforces non-overlapping constraints. Detailed placement determines the achievable quality of the subsequent routing stages.

Standard Cell Design
Standard cell design flow consists of 3 stages

Inputs: PDKs, DRC and LVS rules, SPICE models, library & user-defined specs.
Design Steps: Involves circuit design, layout design, characterization using GUNA tool. Characterization involves timing, power and noise characterizations.
Outputs: CDL (Circuit Description Language), GDSII, LEF(Library Exchange Format), Spice extracted netlist, timing, noise, power libs.
Standard cell characterization refers to gathering data about the behaviour of standard cells. To build the circuit knowledge of logic function of cell alone is not sufficient. Standard cell library has cells with different drive strength and functionalities.These cells are characterized by using tool like GUNA from Paripath.

The standard cell characterization flow involves

Read the model files
Read the extracted spice netlist
Recognize function or behaviour of the cell
Apply stimulus and characterization setup
Vary the output load capacitance and observe the different characterization behaviours
Provide necessary simulation commands
Apply the entire flow to GUNA tool to generate timing, noise and power models.

Design and characterize library cell CMOS inverter
To get the cell files refer standard cell characterization.

Few modifications needs to be done in spice deck file and then run the simulation in ngspice,

invoke the ngspice tool with the modified extracted spice file as input.

Inverter Standard cell characterization Four timing parameters are used to characterize the inverter standard cell:

Rise transition: Time taken for the output to rise from 20% of max value to 80% of max value
Fall transition: Time taken for the output to fall from 80% of max value to 20% of max value
Cell rise delay = time(50% output rise) - time(50% input fall)
Cell fall delay = time(50% output fall) - time(50% input rise)
The above timing parameters can be computed by noting down various values from the ngspice waveform.

Timing analysis and Clock tree synthesis
Covert grid to tracks of the std. cell:
Tracks are used in routing stages. Routes are metal traces which can go over the tracks. The information of horizontal and vertical tracks present in each layer is given in tracks.info file.

To ensure that ports lie on the intersection point, the grid spacing in Magic (tkcon) must be changed to the li1 X and li1 Y values. Convergence of grid and tracks can be achieved using the following command:

grid 0.46um 0.34um 0.23um 0.17um

When extracting LEF file, these ports are what are defined as pins of the macro. These are done in magic tool by adding text with enabling port. tracks_info

Convert Magic Layout to LEF:

Replacing Lef file of the custom designed inverter into picorv32a design. LEF exposes only the necessary things need for the PnR tool and protecting the logic or intellectual property.

A and Y is attached to locali layer and Vdd and Gnd attached to metal1 layer. To set port class and port attribute refer standard cell characterization. Saved it as sky130_invsd.mag
